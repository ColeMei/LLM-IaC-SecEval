# LLM Post-Filter Experiment for GLITCH Detections

## Overview

This experiment implements a **hybrid approach** combining static analysis (GLITCH) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve security smell detection in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts.

**Core Idea**: Use GLITCH for high recall detection, then apply LLM as an intelligent post-filter to reduce false positives while maintaining true positives.

## Problem & Motivation

Current static analysis tools have a fundamental trade-off:

- **High Recall** (~70-90%): Catch most real security issues
- **Low Precision** (~20-30%): Generate many false alarms

This creates **alert fatigue** and reduces tool adoption in practice.

## Hypothesis

**LLMs can act as semantic filters** to:

- Understand code context and intent
- Distinguish real security issues from false alarms
- **Boost precision significantly** while retaining high recall

## Approach

### Two-Stage Detection Pipeline

1. **Stage 1 - GLITCH Detection**: Static analysis identifies potential security smells (high recall)
2. **Stage 2 - LLM Post-Filter**: GPT-4o mini evaluates each detection with context (improved precision)

### Target Security Smells

We focus on **3 security smell categories** where semantic understanding helps:

1. **Hard-coded Secrets**: Distinguish real secrets from placeholders/examples
2. **Suspicious Comments**: Identify security-relevant vs general TODO comments
3. **Weak Cryptography**: Detect actual usage vs documentation mentions

### Evaluation Data

- **Chef & Puppet IaC scripts** with ground truth labels
- **~150 GLITCH detections** to evaluate (mix of true/false positives)
