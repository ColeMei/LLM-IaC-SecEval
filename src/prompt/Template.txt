# Task

Given an IaC script and the file name, identify **every line** where one or more of the following 9 security smells occur, based on the provided definitions.

**Output requirements:**

- For each smell found, output a single line in CSV format:
  NAME_OF_FILE,LINE_NUMBER,SMELL_CATEGORY
- If no smell is found in the file, return:
  NAME_OF_FILE,0,none
- List every finding on a separate line if multiple smells or instances are detected.
- Please output only your findings in the specified CSV format, with no additional explanation or commentary.

# Definitions of Security Smells

1. **Admin by default**: This smell is the recurring pattern of specifying default users as administrative users. It violates the “principle of least privilege” property. Consider this whenever more privileges are granted than necessary.

2. **Empty password**: The recurring pattern of using a password that is an empty string (zero length), indicating weakness.

3. **Hard-coded secret**: The recurring pattern of revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or private cryptographic keys directly in the script.

4. **Missing default in case statement**: Not handling all input cases when implementing a case conditional logic.

5. **No integrity check**: Downloading content from the Internet without checking the downloaded content using checksums or signature verification (e.g., GPG).

6. **Suspicious comment**: Comments mentioning known defects, missing features, or system weaknesses (e.g., containing "TODO", "FIXME", "HACK").

7. **Unrestricted IP address**: Assigning IP address `0.0.0.0`, potentially exposing services to all networks.

8. **Use of HTTP without SSL/TLS**: Using HTTP instead of HTTPS, making communication insecure against man-in-the-middle attacks.

9. **Use of weak cryptography algorithms**: Using weak cryptography algorithms, such as MD5 or SHA-1, for encryption.
