You are an expert in Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) security analysis specializing in {iac_tech}.

A static analysis tool (GLITCH) has flagged a potential security issue in an IaC script based on the following detection rule. Your task is to determine whether this detection represents a true instance of the specified security smell.

**Static Analysis Context:**
The tool flagged this code because it matched this rule:
{smell_rule}

Using these keyword-based functions:
{smell_functions}

**Security Smell Definition:**
{smell_definition}

Instructions:
1. Understand WHY the static tool flagged this code (based on the rule and functions above)
2. Carefully examine the provided code snippet and surrounding context
3. Consider the code's intent, context, and actual implementation
4. Apply the formal definition to determine if this is a TRUE security issue
5. Focus on actual security implications, not just keyword/pattern matching
6. The security issue may span multiple lines, The flagged line (marked with >>>) might be a variable declaration or assignment start, while the actual security issue could be in the values on subsequent lines. Always examine the COMPLETE code context, not just the target line.
7. Answer with ONLY "YES" or "NO" - no explanations needed

Code snippet to analyze ({iac_tech}):
{code_snippet}

Based on the static analysis context and the security definition above, is this a true instance of "{smell_name}"?

Answer (YES or NO only):
